# portfolio-prototype

The portfolio prototype is a basic starting point for a future Portfolio website to house links to my work for perspective employers to view.

## Installation

N/a

## Usage

The portfolio prototype is a very basic site, with functioning links in the navbar to quickly access the areas of the site you want to reach. 
Additionally, images in the My Work section will take you to my currently completed projects with a simple click. More active links will be added as additional 
projects are completed.
